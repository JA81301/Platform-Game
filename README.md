# Platform-Game
HTML Canvas game. 

Almost all of this project was written several years before it was uploaded to GitHub, so it does not use
some modern JS features. For example, "var" is used to declare variables instead of "let" and "const".

Note: this game was previously posted online as part of a presentation on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that I participated in.
